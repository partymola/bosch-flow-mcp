# The patch tag, not `3.14-slim`, and that is what keeps digest updates coming.
# Dependabot treats the tag as the version and will not open a pull request for
# a version one already exists for - and a closed one still counts. The 3 Aug
# `3.13-slim -> 3.14-slim` pull request was closed here, so every later rebuild
# of `3.14-slim` collided with it and went unoffered for seven weeks.
